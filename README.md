# Patry

> Money as a CLI.

Patry is a command-line utility crafted for monitoring financial assets across multiple accounts.
It can consolidate your data into an easy-to-read table,
enabling quick comparison of investment performance and
making financial oversight both efficient and straightforward.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Make sure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com),
[Python](https://www.python.org) **3.10** (or higher),
and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) installed in your machine.

```sh
python --version
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository and navigate into the project directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nebil/patry.git && cd patry
```

2. Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
   to install the project dependencies.  
   **Note:** If you donâ€™t have [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) installed,
   you can manually run the commands defined in [that target](Makefile) instead.

```sh
make venv-with-dependencies
```

3. Copy the [**.env.example**](.env.example) file to **.env**, and update it with your specific values.
More details in [this section](#environment-secrets).

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Activate your virtual environment.

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

5. Youâ€™re all set: start monitoring your assets with Patry.

## How to use

Once installed, run **patry --help** (or just **patry**) to get a list of available arguments and options:

```console
Patry: a command-line interface for monitoring [my] financial assets.

positional arguments:
  <bchile|fintual|renta4|extras|monio>  Select the account(s) to check.

options:
  --no-cache                            Fetch cashflows and store them.
  --with-usd [COLINDEX]                 Include an extra column for USD.
  --loaddata YYYY-MM-DD                 Load historical data from date.
  --savejson [FILENAME]                 Export portfolio to a JSON file.
  --headed                              Show browser UI during execution.
  --verbose, --info                     Set log level at <logging.INFO>.
  --debug                               Set log level at <logging.DEBUG>.
  --version                             Show Patry's version and exit.
  --help                                Display this help message and exit.

```

For instance, to get data from Banco de Chile and Fintual, you would type:

```sh
patry bchile fintual --info
```

### Supported accounts

Patry supports monitoring for several accounts, each with specific assets and fetching methods:

| Name              | Filename        | Type of available assets          | Data fetching method  |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| [Banco de Chile]  | **bchile.py**   | Balance, depÃ³sitos a plazo        | [Playwright]          |
| [Fintual]         | **fintual.py**  | Objetivos                         | Playwright + [HTTPX]  |
| [Renta 4]         | **renta4.py**   | Balance, fondos mutuos, acciones  | Playwright            |
| [AFP Modelo]      | **extras.py**   | Balance                           | Playwright            |

### Key options

- **--no-cache:** Recompute [CAGR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate)
by fetching cashflows, bypassing cache stored in **.patry** files.
- **--with-usd:** Insert a column for asset value in USD,
using rates from [mindicador.cl](https://mindicador.cl/).
- **--loaddata:** Load historical data from a given date. **Only works with Fintual.**
- **--savejson:** Save todayâ€™s data into a file named **output.json**.

### Environment secrets

Before using Patry, configure the following environment variables using your **.env** file.

- **CHILE_ID_NUMBER** is your Chilean RUN/RUT.
- **BCHILE_PASSWORD** is the password for your Banco de Chile account.
- **RENTA4_PASSWORD** is the password for your Renta 4 account.
- **RENTA4_START_DATE** is the date you began using Renta 4.
- **FINTUAL_EMAIL** is the email address linked to your Fintual account.
- **FINTUAL_TOKEN** is a token generated by Fintual to access [their API](https://fintual.cl/api-docs/index.html).
- **FINTUAL_COOKIE** is a browser cookie to simulate a web session at Fintual.
- **MODELO_PASSWORD** is the password for your AFP Modelo account.
- **MONIO** is a list of comma-separated accounts to be fetched when calling **patry monio**.

**Security notice:**
These secrets allow Patry to authenticate and retrieve your financial information.
They are used solely to access your financial accounts directly from your machine,
and they will **never** be transmitted or stored on third-party servers.

## Development

### Dependencies

Patry is built on a handful of dependencies.
Hereâ€™s an overview of the most important ones.

- **[HTTPX]** is a next-gen HTTP client with sync and async APIs.
- **[Playwright]** is a framework for web testing and automation.
- **[PyXIRR]** is a Rust-powered collection of financial functions.
- **[Rich]** is a library for beautiful formatting in the terminal.

### Code health

To keep a (somewhat) healthy codebase, we use four different tools:
[Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff),
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black),
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) &
[doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html).

You can run them all by typingâ€¦

```sh
make --jobs checks
```

## Disclaimer

Please make sure to **review the codebase** before including your credentials.
Although this script performs only read-only operations,
it is wise not to blindly trust code from unknown sources on GitHub.
Just so weâ€™re clearâ€¦
the author assumes no responsibility for any financial issues that could arise from using **Patry**. ðŸ˜‡
